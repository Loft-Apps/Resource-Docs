## Overview of the Resource Manager

The Resource Manager is a web-based production resource management software tool designed to streamline project planning, resource allocation, and financial reporting. Its primary components include the Role Planner, Crew Planner, and financial reporting features.

The Role Planner enables users to efficiently allocate resources within a project by providing a comprehensive view of the project timeline. Users can create and assign roles, customize role attributes, allocate roles to specific periods on the timeline, and track the progress of each role throughout the project.

The Crew Planner integrates with the Role Planner and allows users to overlay role plans onto existing crew schedules. This feature facilitates the identification of potential conflicts or scheduling issues, ensuring efficient resource allocation and project management.

The financial reporting capabilities of the Resource Manager enable users to monitor project costs and make informed budget decisions. By comparing planned resources from the Role Planner to the actual work hours logged by crew members, users can generate accurate financial reports and forecasts. The tool also supports the storage of various rates applied to crew members, allowing for precise cost calculations and projections.

The Resource Manager provides a centralized platform for production resource management, combining project planning, resource allocation, and financial reporting functionalities to improve project efficiency and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

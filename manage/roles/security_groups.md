## Security Groups


Security groups are a way of managing what people see at a higher level than just putting rules on roles.

The roles have the ability to have set access permission

You would click on the access and it would show the various security parameters for that particular role.

However, if you have a many roles within an organization managing the security of each of these roles becomes very cumbersome.  Security groups are a better way of managing permissions, particularly if many of the groups have the same permissions, which is often the case.

The same kinds of permissions that can be applied to roles can also be applied to security groups.  There same security access button that allows you to determine what the security rules are for roles are available to Security Group.

The security group is then applied to the individual roles. One security group can be applied to many roles and each role will acquire the permissions of the security group.

And that means that you can use the same Security Group for multiple roles.  For example, if you have 10 types of producers and they all have the same security level. You only need to create a single Security Group and apply that Security Group to all those producer role type so you don't have to manage each role individually. You can just assign the security group to every one of those roles and this makes it a lot easier to manage the permissions of a large numbers of roles .

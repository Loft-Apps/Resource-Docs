Security Group Manager
========================
The Security Group Manager within the Resource Manager application allows administrators to manage security groups, which control permissions and access levels for different users within the system. Security groups can be assigned to groups, and crew members can be added to these groups, enabling the application of specific permissions to multiple users simultaneously.

## Key Features

Creating and Managing Security Groups: Administrators can create new security groups, define permissions and access levels, and edit or delete existing security groups as needed.

Assigning Security Groups to User Groups: Associate security groups with specific user groups to apply the designated permissions and access levels to all members of those groups.
Adding Crew Members to Groups: Add crew members to user groups to ensure they are granted the appropriate permissions based on their assigned security groups.

## Steps for Managing Security Groups

Access the Security Group Manager within the Resource Manager application.

Locate and click on the "Security Groups" tab to view the list of existing security groups.

To create a new security group, click on the "Create Security Group" button and enter the required information, such as the group name, permissions, and access levels.

Click "Save" to create the new security group.

To edit or delete an existing security group, locate the group in the list and click on the corresponding "Edit" or "Delete" button.

## Assigning Security Groups to User Groups

In the Security Group Manager, click on the "Group Assignments" tab.

Select the security group you wish to assign to a user group.

Choose the desired user group(s) from the list and click "Assign" to associate the security group with the selected groups.

## Adding Crew Members to Groups

Access the Crew Manager or Group Manager within the Resource Manager application.

Locate the crew member or group you want to add members to.

Click on the "Add Member" or "Add Crew Member" button and select the appropriate user(s) from the list.

By effectively managing security groups within the Security Group Manager, administrators can maintain a secure and organized permission structure, ensuring that crew members have appropriate access levels and permissions based on their roles and responsibilities.

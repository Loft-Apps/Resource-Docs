Project Manager Documentation
==============================
The Project Manager within Resource Manager enables administrators to create, delete, edit, and manage project statuses. Administrators can ensure that only projects marked as "In Progress" are visible throughout the application, providing a streamlined experience for users.

## Creating a New Project

This outlines the process of setting up a new project within the platform. It guides users through initiating a project, defining project settings, and allocating resources to ensure an efficient start for project planning and management.

Click the "Create Project" button in the Project Manager.
Fill out the required information, including the project title, initials, color, start date, and end date.
Click "Save" to create the new project.


## Editing a Project
Locate the project you wish to edit in the Project Manager list.
Click the "Edit" button associated with the selected project.
Make the necessary changes to the project details.
Click "Save" to update the project information.


## Deleting a Project
Locate the project you wish to delete in the Project Manager list.
Click the "Delete" button associated with the selected project.
Confirm the deletion to remove the project from the system.

## Managing Project Statuses
Select the project you wish to update in the Project Manager list.
Click the "Status" dropdown menu.
Choose the appropriate status for the project (e.g., "In Progress," "On Hold," or "Complete").
Click "Save" to update the project status.


## Project Status

Project statuses provide a clear overview of a project's current stage within its lifecycle, helping users manage and track project progress effectively. Here are the different project statuses and their descriptions:

**Pending**: The project is awaiting approval or resources to begin work.

**In Progress**: The project has been approved and is actively being worked on by the assigned crew.

**Complete**: The project has been finished, and all tasks have been accomplished.

**On Hold**: The project has been temporarily paused, and no active work is being done. It may be resumed at a later date.

**Cancelled**: The project has been terminated, and no further work will be carried out.


Locate the "Filter by Status" dropdown menu in the Project Manager.
Select the desired project status (e.g., "In Progress").


The Project Manager will display only the projects with the selected status.
By effectively managing projects within the Project Manager, administrators can maintain an organized and up-to-date overview of project statuses, ensuring users focus on relevant projects throughout the Resource Manager application.

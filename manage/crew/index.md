# Crew Manager

The Crew Manager within the Resource Manager application serves as a centralized platform for administrators to manage comprehensive information about crew members in their organization. This section focuses on managing professional and contact information for crew members.

## Managing Crew Members

Access the Crew Manager and navigate to the "Crew Members" tab.

To add a new crew member, click on the "Add Crew Member" button and fill out the required information, such as name, email address, and role.

To edit an existing crew member's information, locate the crew member in the list and click on their name to open their profile.

Update the necessary information, including professional details (e.g., skills, experience, or job title) and contact information (e.g., phone number or email address).

Save the changes to ensure the crew member's profile is up-to-date.

## Managing Crew Member Availability

Within the Crew Manager, access the "Availability" tab.

Select the crew member you wish to update availability for by using the search bar or browsing through the list.

Specify the crew member's availability by selecting the appropriate status (e.g., "Available," "Unavailable," or "Limited Availability") and adding any relevant notes or comments.

Save the availability update to ensure accurate scheduling and resource allocation.

## Searching and Filtering Crew Members

Locate the search bar within the Crew Manager to find specific crew members by name, role, or department.

Use the available filters to refine your search, such as filtering by availability status, project assignments, or custom criteria.

By effectively managing crew member information within the Crew Manager, administrators can maintain an organized and accurate record of their team, facilitating efficient resource allocation and communication throughout the project lifecycle.

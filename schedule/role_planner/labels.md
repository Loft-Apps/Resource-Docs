Managing Labels
===============

The Role Planner within the Resource Manager application allows schedulers to create and assign labels for each week within a role's timeline. These labels can help categorize project sub-sections, such as sequences or milestones, to provide better organization and visibility for project planning. Labels are customizable and can represent any desired categorization.

By effectively managing labels within the Role Planner, schedulers can categorize project sub-sections and improve project organization. This feature allows teams to visualize and track progress within specific segments of a project, facilitating efficient resource allocation and informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

## Opening the Label Manager
Within the Role Planner, you can easily access the Label Manager to view, edit, or delete existing labels. To open the Label Manager, follow these steps:

Locate the "Label" button, typically found in the toolbar of the Role Planner interface.

Click on the "Label" button to open the Label Manager.

The Label Manager will display a list of all existing labels used within the project, along with their corresponding colors and initials.

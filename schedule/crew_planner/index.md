===============================================

The Crew Manager has a Planner which enables schedulers to allocate roles from various project plns into user schedules. This process involves selecting a user, choosing the desired roles from available projects, and booking the required timeframes for each role.
Steps to Book Roles into User Schedules

Open the Planner in the Crew Manager by clicking on the Planner button:

Select the project with the roles needed to allocate.

Upon selecting a department, the Role Allocator will display all available roles associated with projects within that department.  If a specific crew member has been requested for a role, their name will appear as a clickable link next to the role.  Clicking on the crew member's name will initiate a search within the system, displaying the crew member's details, such as their schedule, professional infomation and contact information.

This feature provides a comprehensive overview of resource allocation across multiple projects, enabling efficient project management and streamlined workflows.
